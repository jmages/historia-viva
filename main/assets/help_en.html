<h1><center>Welcome!</center></h1>
This app will help you to find a route and give you information at points along the way. You will not need a data connection, just GPS to help you navigate. It is extremely simple to use:
<ol>
<li>Go into the context menu of the app (usually indicated by three dots) and <b>download a tour</b>. As this involves downloading all the multimedia content onto your SD card, WLAN or WIFI should be used for this. For most devices the Menu button is a physical button on your phone. It is not part of the screen. The icon for the Menu button will look different on different phones.</li>
<li><b>Download the maps/ graphs</b> then you will not need an internet connection en route. (However, they are also available online â€¦)</li>
<li><b>Select:</b> The button <i>Tour selection</i> enables you to access the downloaded tours; <i>Tour overview</i> opens the screen at the correct place for the tour selected.</li>
<li>To use the navigation function you need to enable <b>GPS</b> on your device: if you have not used GPS for some time, it will take your phone/tablet a few minutes to pinpoint your position. After this the button <i>Where am I?</i> will allow you to trace your path along the trail.</li>
<li>Tip: Lengthy tours will deplete your <b>battery</b>: fully charge your device before setting out and possibly do without the internet on the trail (<i>Flight Mode</i>).</li>
</ol>
Have a great trip!
